        I want to be a programmer. I have background in genetics and
        experimental biology. Actually I'm working as a barista in Etno Cafe in
        Wroc≈Çaw. I know how to make a good coffee with great amount of caffeine
        - that will be very helpful in my programming career. For last few
        months I've been learning how to code. I created a few projects, which
        you can see in my "Projects" card.
      </Content>
    </AboutWrapper>
